```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Data Processing

In this example, we will use the classic data set "SacramentocrimeJanuary2006" to make
the map. Firstly, we need to pick up the latitude and longitude columns from the dataframe.
Actually, you can use any data including the map latitude and longitude.

```{r, echo=TRUE, results=FALSE}
data <- "http://samplecsvs.s3.amazonaws.com/SacramentocrimeJanuary2006.csv"
df <- read.csv(url(data))
df <- df[sample(nrow(df), 800), c(8,9)]
```

## Plot the Map

Please install Leaflet package if you don't have it in your R studio. Then you can also map plots, for example:
```{r Leaflet, echo=TRUE}
library(leaflet)
df %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
```
